                The university has made the decision to update the current
                23-year-old student management system as part of a digital
                transformation initiative. This presents a unique opportunity to
                reimagine and enhance the student experience.

                Mapping out the university experience into four stages reveals a
                comprehensive perspective. Understanding this high-level cycle
                is crucial in addressing overarching issues. Ultimately,
                students seek a sense of success during their university
                journey. A continuous and seamless digital experience plays a
                pivotal role in enabling this fulfillment.

                For the past year, I've been leading the design efforts for the
                new student portal project.

                We have initiated the recruitment of students for a pilot
                testing program. The pilot program successfully onboarded{' '}
                <strong>4000</strong> students who actively participated in
                discovering bugs and providing valuable feedback. Their
                engagement has been instrumental in enhancing the portal's user
                experience and shaping its successful implementation.

              <div className={c.description}>
                This project has truly been a labor of love, with an immense
                amount of effort poured into its success. The overwhelmingly
                positive feedback, constituting 92.3% approval from students,
                stands as a testament to our dedication and hard work. We are
                eagerly anticipating the portal's launch in early 2024, poised
                to provide students with an outstanding digital experience that
                reflects our commitment to excellence.
