                The university has made the decision to update the current
                23-year-old student management system as part of a digital
                transformation initiative. This presents a unique opportunity to
                reimagine and enhance the student experience.

                Mapping out the university experience into four stages reveals a
                comprehensive perspective. Understanding this high-level cycle
                is crucial in addressing overarching issues. Ultimately,
                students seek a sense of success during their university
                journey. A continuous and seamless digital experience plays a
                pivotal role in enabling this fulfillment.

                For the past year, I've been leading the design efforts for the
                new student portal project.

              <div className={c.description}>
                We have initiated the recruitment of students for a pilot
                testing program. The pilot program successfully onboarded 4000
                students who actively participated in discovering bugs and
                providing valuable feedback. Their engagement has been
                instrumental in enhancing the portal's user experience and
                shaping its successful implementation.
              </div>
              <div className={c.description}>
                This project has been a labor of love, with tremendous effort
                dedicated to its success. The overwhelmingly positive feedback
                from students has been a testament to our hard work. We eagerly
                anticipate launching the portal in the second half of 2023,
                providing students with an outstanding digital experience.

                After the launch, I'll be updating this project with further
