              In 2020, we faced numerous challenges, including restrictions on
              international travel. During these times, students require
              additional support in choosing their courses and navigating their
              academic journey. Course Mapper aims to alleviate the burden on
              the Student Service Desk by providing guidance to students during
              these uncertain times, helping them select their units and
              complete their degrees with ease.

                Our goal for the project was to transform a paper-based, manual
                and time-consuming course mapping progress to a smooth, seamless
                and easy online experience.

                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  Course advisers often need to refer to a multitude of
                  information sources during the course mapping process. As a
                  result, a multitude of tabs—comprising web pages and local
                  files—inevitably clutter the workspace.

                  Course advisers are working with data from different sources

                  As students receive course advice from multiple advisers
                  during their study, the manual process makes it challenging to
                  refer back to previous suggested course plans easily.

                I had the privilege of leading the design of the course advice
                experience. This involved close collaboration with fellow
                designers, as well as actively contributing to the front-end
                development. Together, we crafted an innovative and user-centric
                course advice system that enhances the academic journey for
                staff and students.

                  Our team of designers conducted extensive interviews with
                  end-users, encompassing both staff and students. These
                  interviews aimed to uncover the existing process, pain points,
                  opportunities, and user expectations for the app. Using this
                  valuable insight, we mapped out the current process,
                  translating it into detailed steps and actions.

                  Using the insights from my research and analysis, I
                  facilitated multiple high-level brainstorming sessions to
                  uncover the root flow of the problem.

                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  Additionally, we addressed other pain points through multiple
                  brainstorming sessions, collectively striving to identify the
                  most effective and optimal solutions.
                </div>
                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  In this example, one of the pain points lies in the existence
                  of hundreds of PDF course progression maps maintained by
                  faculties, each with different formats. As a proof of concept,
                  I manually mapped three courses to showcase the potential
                  value of our solution.

                  This approach emerged as the most cherished and widely
                  embraced feature among course advisors. Currently, with
                  dedicated resources and assistance, we have successfully
                  digitized thousands of historical PDF course maps.

                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  Now, we aim to initiate a new project to build digital course

                  accessibility.

                  Understanding the critical role advisors play in guiding

                  recommendations.

                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  This includes displaying essential student information, such
                  as names and IDs, for quick reference and easy access.
                  Moreover, we provide a seamless way for advisors to switch
                  between students they are advising.

                <div className={c.subDescription}>
                  Furthermore, we enhance clarity by indicating unit counts for

                  By streamlining processes and presenting data in a meaningful

                  well-informed decisions. This approach not only saves time but
                  also elevates the advising experience, ultimately empowering
                  advisors to provide comprehensive and valuable support to
                  students.
